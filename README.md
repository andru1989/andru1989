# Experience

I'm analyst and software developer graduated from SENA, with more than 11 years of experience building/designing web applications using agile development, my main experience and abilities are focused on application development under MVC (Model View Controller) paradigm, applications construction using object-oriented principles and functional programming using JavaScript.
I have been in touch in some projects with JavaScript, jQuery, React, React Native, EmberJS, Elixir and CSS following best practices like unit testing, continuous integration, SCRUM, refactoring, code standards, providing solutions in topics like financial, billing, legal collection, statistics, reporting applications, marketplaces and health. Always eager to learn.
